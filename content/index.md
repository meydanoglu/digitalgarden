Hello, I am Emin Meydanoglu, studying robotics engineering at [Istanbul Technical University](https://www.itu.edu.tr/). Apart from my passion in robotics and autonomous systems, I am also passionate about physics, philosophy, and on how to live a good life.
This website consists of the pages I choose to share from my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault, which is literally my brain. 

Here are some of the main maps of content you can find on this brain: 
- [[Engineering]]: Cool technical writings, mainly on computer science, electrical engineering, artificial intelligence, engineering mathematics and physics.
- [[Philosophy]]: Writings, learning notes and personal thoughts about the big questions of life.
- [[Science]]: Interesting science topics I learned that are not very related to engineering.
